# 3DEngine
'3DEngine' is a simple 3D engine written in C# with OpenTK. It is a work-in-progress, and will be a little start-stop between other portfolio projects.

This was formerly a project called 'Wolfenclone', intended to be a classic raycaster in the style of id Software's Wolfenstein and Doom. 
With OpenGL, a regular 3D engine was counterintuitively easier. 
I've made this new repository, and cloned the original C# source code, with a few small adjustments.

## Here's an earlier build of the engine:
